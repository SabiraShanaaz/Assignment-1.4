1.Describe the characteristics of Big data in detail.
         The characteristics of big data are:
           
          *Volume:
                  The quantity of generated and stored data (ie) the amount of data.

          *Variety:
                   The type and nature of the data.It can be structured,unstructed or semi structed data.

          *Velocity:
                    The speed at which the data is generated and processed. 

          *Veracity:
                    Veracity refers to the messiness or trustworthiness of data.
                        It also refers to the noise and abnormality in data.
          *Value: 
                 Value includes a large volume and variety of data that is easy to access
                             and delivers quality analytics that enables informed decisions.
                                 Value is an important tool.Big data is made useful by turning it into value.


2.Explain the possible solutions to handle Big data.
          The possible solution of big data are:

             *Scale-up:
                      -Scale up refers to the storing of resources on the single machine 
                            (ie) if a file is of tetabytes, the entire file is stored on a single machine.
                                
                      -In case of failure the entire file get lost.
                    
                      -The resources are processed via parallel processing and faster memory access.
              
             *Scale-out:
                       -Scale out refers to horizontal scaling.In scale out the resources are splitted and then stored
                           (ie) if a file is of terabyte they are broken down into gigabyte and then they can be saved.

                       -In case of failure the portion can be easily retrieved due to small volume of data.




3.Explain the differences between scaling up and scaling out.

             *Scaling up:
                      -Scaling up refers to vertical scaling.

                      -Scale up refers to the storing of resources on the single machine 
                            (ie) if a file is of tetabytes, the entire file is stored on a single machine.
                                
                      -In case of failure the entire file get lost.
                    
                      -The resources are processed via parallel processing and faster memory access.

             *Scaling out:
                     
                      -Scale out refers to horizontal scaling.In scale out the resources are splitted and then stored
                               (ie) if a file is of terabyte they are broken down into gigabyte and then they can be saved.

                      -In case of failure the portion can be easily retrieved due to small volume of data.
